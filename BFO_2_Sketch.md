# Alan's notes #

Alan's opinion only:

  * Add relations essential to working with BFO
    * inheres\_in, bearer\_of
    * participates\_in,has\_participant
    * part\_of, has\_part
    * realizes, realized\_by
    * relations to spatial, temporal, and spatio-temporal regions.
    * dependecy super-property
    * bounds
  * Distinguish type level versus instance level relations
  * Based on OWL 2/CL
  * [Determinable and determinate qualities](Bfo2DeterminableDeterminate.md)
  * [Temporal derivative](Bfo2DeterminableDeterminate.md)
  * [Quantities](Bfo2DeterminableDeterminate.md)
  * [Extended and instantaneous determinate quality instances](Bfo2DeterminableDeterminate.md)
  * Physical fields, that depend but don't necessarily inhere in anything
  * Body of energy (dual with mass)
  * Candidates for dropping
    * Subclasses of spatial region
    * [Proper\_parthood](Proper_parthood.md).
    * Process (rename ProcessualEntity->Process).
    * ProcessualContext
  * Candidates for reorganization
    * Disposition super function, role. Disposition syn: Capability?
    * Object aggregate, fiat object part as defined classes defined with new relations.
    * Consider reorganizing dependent/independent split because "dependent" currently doesn't cover all cases of  dependence.
  * Rewrite documentation to be usable, correct errors
    * Clarify sites as immaterial continuants. Explain parts, region relations
    * Include more [citations](Bfo2Citations.md) to papers that discuss various elements of the theory behind certain entities.
